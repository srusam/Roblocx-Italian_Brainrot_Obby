## ✨ **About This Project**
Welcome to my **first-ever Roblox game**! 🎮  
I’ve been a playing Roblox since a year, but this is the **first time I built a game from scratch** using Roblox Studio.  

It took me about **a month** to complete because:  
- I was **new to Roblox Studio’s UI**  
- I had to juggle other commitments  
- And yes, I fought with **checkpoints, respawning**, and these bugs still appear occasionally 😅  

The game runs **smoothly on PC**, but may lag a little on mobile.  
Despite the challenges, I’m proud of finishing it and would love your support!
